## Dashboards  
### 1. Churn Summary Dashboard  
[![Summary-Dashboard.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Gt9sP90t/Summary-Dashboard.png)](https://postimg.cc/gLFJmz2b)
- Overall churn rate and KPIs  
- Breakdown by contract type, service, payment method, geography  
- Demographic insights (age, tenure)  

### 2. Prediction Dashboard  
[![Prediction-Dashboard.png](https://i.postimg.cc/R0R3jw4q/Prediction-Dashboard.png)](https://postimg.cc/5HXNzYHM)
- ML model predicted customers likely to churn  
- Churn probability segmentation (High / Medium / Low risk)  
- Revenue at risk due to churn   

---

## Machine Learning Model  
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest  
- **Data Split:** 80/20 train-test  
- **Performance:** ROC-AUC = 0.89 
- **Output:** Probability of churn + classification buckets (High, Medium, Low risk)  

---

## Key Findings  
- **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn (46.5%).  
- **Fiber optic customers** churn at 41.1%.  
- **Mailed check payment** method has 37.8% churn.  
- **Certain states** (J&K, Assam, Jharkhand) show significantly higher churn.  
- ML model predicted **379 customers at risk** (~â‚¹43,000 monthly revenue impact).  

---

## Business Recommendations  
1. Incentivize annual contracts to reduce short-term churn.  
2. Improve retention offers for fiber optic & multi-service customers.  
3. Promote auto-pay/digital payments.  
4. Focus service quality in high-churn geographies.  
5. Use ML outputs for proactive customer care interventions.
